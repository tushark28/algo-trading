# algo-trading

This is a Algo trading microservice which uses upstox's API and publishes information on discord using webhooks.
Website API's and other services aren't published due to security issues.
This is only for educational purposes, as in this Repository we've implemented a test strategy so that others can develop after it. (No real Strategy is present in this code)
